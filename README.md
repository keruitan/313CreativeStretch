This repository utilizes a LEAP Motion Sensor.  The Creative Stretch HTML file acts as a puppet show involving Pacman and a Pacman Ghost.
The characters can be moved around using one's hands. The left hand controls the Ghost, while the right hand controls Pacman. When the 
user closes either fist, the BoneHand guides disappear. When the user pinches their right hand, Pacman's mouth opens and closes.
